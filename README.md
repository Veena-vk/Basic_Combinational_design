# Basic_Combinational_design
This repository consists of codes for basic combinational circuit design in both Verilog and VHDL

The main contains several branches for each circuit design. 
In each branch, both verilog as well as VHDL codes are given.
Along with that, sample RTL schematics for each design are also provided as images.
